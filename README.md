# Public_Unsupervised_Clustering

We will be using the mortgage affordability provided by Zillow https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ to get experience with unsupervised learning methods. In particular we will use K-means clustering and two dimensionality reduction methods, one based on matrix decomposition and one based on manifold learning.
